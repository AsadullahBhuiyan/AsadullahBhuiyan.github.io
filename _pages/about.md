Welcome! I’m Asadullah Bhuiyan (Asad), a PhD student in theoretical physics at Cornell University. My research focuses on adaptive quantum circuits, entanglement dynamics, and the classification of dynamical phases in open quantum systems. 

I enjoy blending mathematical precision with physical insight, and I’m passionate about understanding the deep structure of quantum systems. Beyond research, I’m building this site as a home for my work, papers, notes, and occasional thoughts on physics, computation, and life in academia.
